### Dunder/Magic Methods

* Dunder or Magic methods in Python are special methods identified by double underscores at the beginning and end of their names (e.g., __init__, __str__).

* Double + Under = Dunder

* They enable customization of the behavior of objects in Python, allowing operations like addition, comparison, string representation, and more to be defined for user-defined classes.

* Dunder methods are automatically invoked by the Python interpreter under specific circumstances, such as object instantiation, addition, comparison, and conversions, making them essential for creating intuitive and customized classes.

* Proper utilization of dunder methods improves code readability and usability, making code more expressive and aligned with Pythonic conventions.
