    - Singleton
    - Factory

* Exercises

### Singleton

* A singleton pattern is a class where only one instance is ever created.

* Because of this, they are often used to provide the same object to any part of the code.

* This means that they act as a global scope manager.

* There are different ways to implement a singleton.


### Factory design pattern

* The factory method is a creational design pattern that allows to create objects.

* one of the advantages of the factory method is the ability to define classes on runtime.

* Factory methods encapsulate the object creation process within a separate method or class, allowing for clear separation and abstraction of object instantiation from the client code.

* This approach promotes modularity and helps maintain a single point for object creation, reducing dependencies and improving the code's flexibility.

* This pattern fosters extensibility, making it easier to add new object types by creating additional factory methods or extending the existing ones.

* They assist in managing complex object creation procedures, such as initialization, configuration, or resource allocation, by abstracting these details into dedicated factory methods.
