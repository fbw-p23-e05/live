- Recap
- try...except...else...finally

## Custom exceptions

- we can define custom exceptions by creating a new class that is derived(inherits) from the built-in `Exception` class.
- Best practice dictates that custom exceptions should be defined in a separate file namely `exceptions.py` or `errors.py`
