# Control Flow

- A program's control flow is the order in which the code is executed.
- The control flow of a Python program is regulated by conditional statements, loops and function calls.

Python has 3 types of control structures:
    - Sequential - default
    - Selection - used fore decisions and branching.
    - Repetition - used for looping, i.e, repeating a piece of code multiple times.

## Comparison operators

| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| == | Equal to |
| != | Not equal to |
| < | Less than |
| > | Greater than |
| <= | Less than or equal to |
| >= | Greater than or equal to |



1. Sequential

    These are set of statements whose execution process happens in a sequence. 
    - with sequential statements if the logic is broken in any of the lines, then the rest of the code will not execute.

2. Selection/Decision control statements

    - The selection statement allows a program to test several conditions and execute instructions based on the condition that is true.

    Some of the decision control statements are:
        - if
        - if-else
        - nested if
        - if-elif-else

3. Repetition 

    - A repetition statement is used to repeat a block of code multiple times. (looping)

    - We have 2 repetition statements in Python:
        - `for` loop - uses a counter. Iterates over lists, dictionaries, tuple or sets.
        - `while` loop - uses a condition.
