# Bitwise AND operator
"""
AND operator returns 1 if both the bits are 1, otherwise 0

# Bitwise OR operator
"""
OR operator returns 1 if any of the bits are 1. If both bits are 0 it returns 0.

# Bitwise XOR operator
"""
XOR operator returns 1 if one of the bits is 0 and the other bit is 1.
If boths bits are 1 it returns 0. If both bits are 0 it returns 0.

"""
Bitwise left shift operator shifts the left operand 
bits towards the left side for the given number of times in the right operand.
The binary number is appended with 0's at the end.

# Bitwise Right Shift Operator
"""
Right shift operator moves the left side operands bits towards the right for the givem number of times.
Right side bits are removed.
