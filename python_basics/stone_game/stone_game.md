# Stone Game 

You are assigned to create a Python program for a two-player game called the "Stone Game." 
Follow the steps below to complete the task: 

    1. Ask the user to input the total number of stones in the pile. 
    
    2. Ask the user to input the maximum number of stones that can be taken at once. 
    
    3. Prompt the user to enter the names of the two players. 
    
    4. Ask the user to input the player number who will start the game (1 for Player 1, 2 for 
    Player 2). 
    
    5. Implement a game loop that continues as long as there are stones left in the pile: 
    
        a. Print the current number of stones in the pile. 
        b. Prompt the current player (whose turn it is) to enter a number of stones they want 
        to take (between 1 and the maximum allowed). 
        c. Check if the input is valid and subtract the chosen number of stones from the pile. 
        d. If the pile is empty, break the loop. 
    6. Determine the winner based on the player who removes the last stone from the pile. 
    
    7. Display the name of the winning player.
