## **How Bubble Sort Works:**

1. **Compare and Swap**: Start from the first element and compare it with the next one. If the first element is greater, swap them.

2. **Repeat**: Move to the next pair of elements and repeat the comparison and swapping process.

3. **One Pass**: Continue this process until you've gone through the entire list without making any swaps.

4. **Repeat Again**: Repeat steps 1 to 3 until no more swaps are needed.


## **How Quick Sort Works**:

1. Choose a pivot element.

2. Divide the list into three sub-arrays: elements less than the pivot (left), elements equal to the pivot (middle), and elements greater than the pivot (right).

3. Recursively sort the left and right sub-arrays.


4. Combine the sorted left, middle, and right sub-arrays to obtain the sorted list.


## **How Merge Sort Works**:

1. Divide the unsorted list into two halves until each sub-list contains one element (these are sorted by definition).


2. Merge the sub-lists, comparing and combining them into a new sorted list.

3. Continue merging and sorting until the entire list is sorted.
