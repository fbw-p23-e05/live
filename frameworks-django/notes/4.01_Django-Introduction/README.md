# Introduction to Django as a Web Framework

## What is Django?
Django is a high-level web framework for Python that helps in building web applications quickly and efficiently. It is free and open source and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

## Why use Django?
Django provides a lot of functionality out of the box, including an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system for working with databases, a templating engine for building dynamic web pages, and an easy-to-use administrative interface for managing the application. Django is also highly scalable and can handle high traffic websites with ease.

## Where to use Django?
Django can be used in a wide range of applications, from building simple websites to developing complex web applications for businesses, e-commerce platforms, social networks, and more.

## How to install and set up a Django project from scratch?
To install Django, you can use pip, the package manager for Python. Open the terminal/command prompt and run the following command:
```
pip install django
```
Once Django is installed, you can create a new Django project by running the following command:
```
django-admin startproject myproject
```
This will create a new project directory called 'myproject' with some boilerplate code and files.

## What are the generated boilerplate code/files of a new Django Project and their objectives?
When you create a new Django project, the following files and directories are created:
- manage.py: This is a command-line utility that allows you to perform various tasks related to the project, such as running the development server, creating database tables, and more.
- myproject/: This directory contains the settings for the project, including the database settings, installed apps, and more.
- myproject/__init__.py: This file is empty and is required to mark the directory as a Python package.
- myproject/settings.py: This file contains the settings for the project, including the database settings, installed apps, and more.
- myproject/urls.py: This file contains the URL routing for the project, which maps URLs to views.
- myproject/asgi.py and myproject/wsgi.py: These files are used for deploying the project to a production server.

## How to run a Django project?
To run a Django project, navigate to the project directory in the terminal/command prompt and run the following command:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
This will start the development server and you can access the application by going to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

## How to run the initial migrations?
Before running the application, you need to create the database tables. To do this, run the following commands:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
This will create the necessary database tables based on the models defined in the application.

In summary, Django is a powerful web framework for Python that provides a lot of functionality out of the box. It follows the MVC architectural pattern and can be used to build a wide range of web applications. To get started, you can install Django, create a new project, and run the initial migrations. Then, you can start building your application using the Django features and functionalities.
